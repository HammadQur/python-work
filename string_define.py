print('''In twilight’s gentle, fading glow,
The stars above begin to show,
A canvas dark, a silver thread,
Where dreams are whispered, softly said.

The winds they hum a secret song,
A melody both pure and strong,
It carries tales from far and wide,
Of hearts that ache and souls that glide.

The moon, a guardian in the sky,
Watches over, silent, high,
And in its light, the world grows still,
A peaceful calm, a quiet thrill.

So let the night embrace your heart,
Where all the busy days depart,
And in the silence, you will find
The dreams that live within your mind''')  # iska advantage ye hai kay ye kisi bhi baray paragraph ko tarteeb deta hai or bina kisi error kay  run karta hai.
